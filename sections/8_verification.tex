\subsubsection{Code Coverage}

The code coverage is a measurement of how much of the code is exercised by the test cases.

% TODO: Add note on how the Go code coverage is calculated.

While developing a lexer for the LLVM IR assembly language the intention was to strive for a 100\% code coverage of any code related to lexing and not related to input output errors (e.g. ``file not found'' errors). As illustrated in figure \ref{lexer_code_coverage}. The rigid testing made it possible to locate and correct a number of faulty assumptions in the lexing logic.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{verbatim}
$ go test -coverprofile=lexer.out github.com/mewlang/llvm/asm/lexer
$ go tool cover -func=lexer.out

		\caption{A summary of the code coverage for a selection of the LLVM IR lexer functions, as visualized by the \texttt{cover} tool.}
		\label{lexer_code_coverage}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The use of code coverage heat maps, which track how often statements are exercised by the test cases, were invaluable when stress testing the subgraph isomorphism search algorithm, and they were able to identify several tricky corner cases. \ref{iso_heat_map}

% --- [ Performance ] ----------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Performance}

% TODO: Rewrite, cleanup and verify (especially the \theta(...) claims!).

Profiling was put to good use when optimizing the lexer, the code base of which is rather straight forward. When estimating the runtime complexity of the subgraph isomorphism search algorithm however the use of intuition and algorithm research was far more valuable. For this specific task the generic problem (subgraph isomorphism search of arbitrary input graphs) could be simplified (TODO: use generalized instead of simplified?) to a much easier problem as every node of the graph were known to be connected (TODO: find the succinct term in graph theory to express this concept). Exploiting this property lead to an algorithm that had a runtime complexity of $ \Theta(n*m) $ where $ m $ is known to be small rather than $ \Theta(n^m) $ as is the case for a brute force algorithm and $ \Theta(n^log(m)) $ (TODO: Find the correct runtime complexity of the Hillman iso search algo) as was the case of the Hillman subgraph isomorphism search algorithm which is capable of solving the generic case, improving on the brute force approach by applying heuristics (TODO: is heuristics the right word to use here?) to prune the search space.

In summary, using profiling is great for simple problems. Using algorithm research, runtime complexity theory and intuition is needed for complex problems. Knowledge about specific properties of the problem which may be exploited.

% --- [ Continuous Integration ] -----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Continuous Integration}

The Continuous Integration (CI) practise originated from the Extreme Programming methodology \cite{xp} but has reached a much broader audience in recent years. Today most large scale software projects rely on CI server farms which continuously compile and test new versions of the source code.

This project makes use of Travis CI, which is tightly integrated with GitHub, to run a series of automated tests for each commit to the source code repository. The tests are varied and range from identifying source code formatting and coding style issues to monitoring the build status and test coverage. A future ambition is to run benchmarks for each commit to quickly identify performance regressions.

\subsubsection{Source Code Formatting}

Instead of relying on a formatting style guide the Go project enforces a single formatting style using \texttt{gofmt} (a tool similar to \texttt{indent}) which automatically formats Go source code. The adoption of this tool is widespread within the Go community as indicated by a survey conducted back in 2013. The survey found that 70\% of the publicly available Go packages were formatted according to the rules of \texttt{gofmt} \cite{gofmt_70percent}, a figure which is likely to have increased since then.

Using a single formatting style for all Go source code may at first seem like a small deal, but the advantages are vast. It becomes easier to write code as one may focus on the problem at hand rather than minor formatting issues. Similarly it becomes easier to read code when it is formatted in a familiar and uniform manner. We may focus our entire attention at understanding the semantics of the code without being distracted by inconsistent or unfamiliar formatting. And perhaps most importantly, it prevents useless discussions about which formatting style is the right one.

Several text editors supports adding pre-save hooks which executes a command to pre-process the text before saving it. This mechanism may be used with the \texttt{gofmt} tool to automatically enforce its formatting style each time a source file is saved. One of the CI tests catches and reports incorrectly formatted source code, should a programmer forget to install such a hook.
