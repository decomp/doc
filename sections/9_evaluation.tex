% <howto>
% - You should describe how you demonstrated that system works as intended (or not, as the case may be)
% - Include comprehensible summaries of the results of all critical tests that you made.
% - You should try to indicate how confident you are about whatever code you have produced, and also suggest what tests would be required to gain further confidence.
% - You must also critically evaluate your system in the light of these tests, describing its strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This section evaluates the artefacts of the decompilation system against the requirements outlined in section \ref{sec:requirements}. To assess the capabilities of the individual components, relevant decompilation scenarios have been considered. The current state of each component is summarized in the succeeding paragraphs, and future work to validate the design, improve the reliability, and extend the capabilities of the decompilation pipeline is presented in section \ref{sec:con_future_work}.

The \texttt{ll2dot} component (see section \ref{sec:design_control_flow_graph_generation}) is considered stable, but there are known issues which may affect the reliability and the integrity of the produced CFGs; as further described in section \ref{sec:ver_security_assessment}. Future work to address these issues is presented in section \ref{sec:con_reliability_improvements}.

The subgraph isomorphism search library (see section \ref{sec:impl_subgraph_isomorphism_search_algorithm}) is considered production quality, and the test cases of the \texttt{iso}\footnote{Subgraph isomorphism search library: \url{https://decomp.org/x/graphs/iso}} package have a code coverage of 94.8\%\footnote{As of Git revision \texttt{d628df12f15385fa27fbaa1791d3a66f6d6abeac}}; as outlined in section \ref{sec:ver_code_coverage}. The restrictions imposed by this library on the subgraph (e.g. single-entry/single-exit invariant and fixed number of nodes) limits infinite loops and n-way conditionals from being modelled, as further discussed in section \ref{sec:design_control_flow_analysis}. Future work which seeks to address these limitations is presented in section \ref{sec:con_design_validation}

The \texttt{restructure} component (see section \ref{sec:design_control_flow_analysis}) is considered production quality, and the test cases of the \texttt{restructure} command have a code coverage of 45.8\%\footnote{As of Git revision \texttt{6e8757257e575058969f3deb7e39ce9f58d1e799}}; as outlined in section \ref{sec:ver_code_coverage}. The \texttt{restructure} command is believed to be capable of structuring the CFG of any source program which may be constructred from the set of supported high-level control flow primitives (see figure \ref{fig:graph_representations} of section \ref{sec:lit_review_control_flow_analysis}), including source programs with arbitrarily nested primitives.

The \texttt{ll2go} component (see section)

% TODO: Add a confidence section. The control flow analysis component is considered mature. The code generation and post-processing components are considered as proof of concept implementations. Specifically the post-processing provides rudamentary support for expression propagation, which works for simple programs, but will most certainly be inaccurate for more complex programs. All source code transformation rules of the \texttt{go-post} tool may be optionally enabled or disabled. Proper support for data flow analysis will be implemented in the future, as described in section \ref{foo}.
