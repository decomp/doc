% <howto>
% - You should describe how you demonstrated that system works as intended (or not, as the case may be)
% - Include comprehensible summaries of the results of all critical tests that you made.
% - You should try to indicate how confident you are about whatever code you have produced, and also suggest what tests would be required to gain further confidence.
% - You must also critically evaluate your system in the light of these tests, describing its strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This section evaluates the artefacts of the decompilation system against the requirements outlined in section section \ref{sec:requirements}. To assess the capabilities of the individual components, relevant decompilation scenarios have been considered.

% TODO: Add a confidence section. The control flow analysis component is considered mature. The code generation and post-processing components are considered as proof of concept implementations. Specifically the post-processing provides rudamentary support for expression propagation, which works for simple programs, but will most certainly be inaccurate for more complex programs. All source code transformation rules of the \texttt{go-post} tool may be optionally enabled or disabled. Proper support for data flow analysis will be implemented in the future, as described in section \ref{foo}.
