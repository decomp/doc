\subsubsection{Intermediate Code Generation}

% TODO: <note> remove?
% "Most compilers translate the source program first to some form of intermediate representation and convert from there into machine code. The intermediate representation is a machine- and language-independent version of the original source code. Although converting the code twice introduces another step, use of an intermediate representation provides advantages in increased abstraction, cleaner separation between the front and back ends, and adds possibilities for re-targeting/cross-compilation. Intermediate representations also lend themselves to supporting advanced compiler optimizations and most optimization is done on this form of the code."
