% TODO: Reformulate and check Mycroft reference.

The purpose of the type analysis stage is to infer the types of variables, parameters and functions. The main method for obtaining this information is through type constraint equations as pioneered by A. Mycroft

The main purpose of the type analysis stage is to infer the types of variables and parameters.




In contrast to A. Mycroft et al. \cite{type_based_decomp}, I. Guilfanov argues that the type analysis stage should be deferred to as late as possible. Only then may one resonably solve the type equations \cite{hexrays}.
