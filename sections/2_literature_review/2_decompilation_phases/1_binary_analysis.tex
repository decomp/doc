\subsubsection{Binary Analysis}
\label{sec:binary_analysis}

As demonstrated in section \ref{sec:executable_anatomy} parsing even a simple \textit{``hello world''} executable requires extensive knowledge of its binary file format (in this case ELF). The binary analysis phase is responsible for parsing input files of various binary file formats, such as PE and ELF, and present their content in a uniform manner which preserves the relations between file contents, virtual addresses and access permissions. Later stages of the decompilation pipeline builds upon this abstraction to access the file contents of each segment or section without worrying about the underlying file format. Information about external symbols, metadata and the computer architecture of the assembly may also be provided by this abstraction.
