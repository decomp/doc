\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

This section evaluates a set of open source projects which may be utilised by the front-end of the decompilation pipeline, to translate native code into LLVM IR (see section \ref{sec:rel_work_native_code_to_llvm_ir}). Section \ref{sec:rel_work_hex-rays_decompiler} reviews the design of the de facto decompiler used in industry, to gain a better understanding of how it solves the non-trivial problems of decompilation (e.g. how to separate code from data).
