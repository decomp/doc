% TODO: Review the following paragraph and make sure it feels right.

The principle of separation of concern has had a core influence on the design of the decompilation system. It has motivated a system architecture based on the composition of independent and self-contained components. Users of the system are thereby given the freedom to make use of the components they see fit, and may compose a custom decompilation system to solve a given task.

foo

Several smaller components may conceptually be arranged in a pipeline of stages which transform, massage or interpret the input in a certain way to solve larger tasks. A well composed pipeline is capable of solving more complex problems than each of its components, problems which may not even have been envisioned by the original component authors \cite{simplicity_and_collaboration}. This idea is embodied in the Unix philosophy and it has influenced software construction profoundly \cite{art_of_unix}. Furthermore, systems which expose their individual components to end-users facilitate dynamic workflows, as they enable users to adapt and extend each part of the system by adding, removing, replacing or refining
components in one or more stages of the pipeline.

Each component is given access to the least amount of information required to successfully accomplish its task (e.g. the control flow analysis stage operates on control flow graphs and is unaware of the underlying code).

% TODO: <note> remove?
% Each component is self-contained and may be replaced or used individually. It is possible to start with any component and use existing tools to bridge the gaps. <<< MOTIVATION: several starting points for a complex problem.

% TODO: Add
%   - The system must be language-agnostic so that decompilation passes can be reused from other programming language environments.
