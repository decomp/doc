\subsubsection{Control Flow Analysis}
\label{sec:design_control_flow_analysis}

% TODO: Describe where the "restructure" component fits in the overall decompilation pipeline. Mention which projects and tools that may be used to fill the gaps. bin_descend and IDA python script of MC-Semantics -> Google Protocol Buffer -> cfg_to_bc -> LLVM IR

%TODO: Add: A data-driven design separates data from source code to facilitate the extensibility of components.

% TODO: Refer back to "each with access to the least amount of information required to successfully accomplish its task". Working on control flow graph, oblivious to the presence of LLVM IR or instructions for that matter.

% TODO: Add
% * Subgraph Isomorphism Search Algorithm}

% * Data-driven Design (potential and limitations)
% TODO: Mention: CFG invariants (e.g. single-entry, single-exit)
% TODO: Add notes about the use of DOT-files to describe control flow primitives. Think if and how this could be pushed further to facilitate the development of future back-ends.

% TODO: Add: Limitations

% TODO: Add limitations related to the design choices. Which limitations are easily solvable given more time and which are fundamentally part of the design.
%    - No support for n-way conditionals (e.g.switch-statements). Potential solution: Domain Specific Language; e.g. switch could be written as:
%
%    digraph switch {
%       A -> B [label="expr='n > 2'; label='case %d'"]
%       A -> C
%       B -> C
%    }
%    - No support for inf-loops (because of the CFG invariant). Potential solution: relax invariant to support control flow primitive descriptors which only specify an entry node? These control flow primitives would have to be marked as no-exit.

%    - Unstructured CFG -> Structured CFG ([restructure](http://decomp.org/x/graphs/cmd/restructure).)

The control flow analysis component structures low-level code by identifying high-level control flow primitives in the control flow graphs generated from the code (see section \ref{sec:cfg_generation}). As demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:representation_and_identification_of_primitive}, high-level control flow primitives may be represented using graphs. The problem of structuring low-level code may therefore be reformulated as the problem of locating subgraphs (e.g. the graph representations of control flow primitives) in graphs (e.g. the control flow graphs of low-level code) without considering node names. This problem is generally referred to as \textit{subgraph isomorphism search} and has been well studied \cite{subgraph_isomorphism_algorithms}.
