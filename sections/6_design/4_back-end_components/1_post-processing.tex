\subsubsection{Post-processing}
\label{sec:design_post-processing}

The post-processing stage post-processes the unpolished Go source code from the earlier stages of the decompilation pipeline, by applying a set of source code transformations. The \texttt{go-post} tool improves the quality of Go source code by declaring unresolved identifiers, applying Go conventions for exit status codes, propagating temporary variables into expressions, simplifying binary operations, removing dead assignment statements, and promoting the initialisation statement and post-statement of for-loops to the loop header; as demonstrated by the step-by-step refinement of the unpolished source code in presented appendix \ref{app:post-processing_example}.
