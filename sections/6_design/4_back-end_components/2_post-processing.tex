%    - Unpolished Go -> Go ([go-post](http://decomp.org/x/cmd/go-post))

foo

The polishing is done by separate tools which fixes potential compilation issues and makes the code more idiomatic.

Currently the \texttt{go-post} replaces return-statements in the \texttt{main} function with calls to \texttt{os.Exit}, which is required since the \texttt{main} function has no return arguments in Go. Instead the Go runtime calls \texttt{os.Exit} with the status-code \texttt{0} once \texttt{main} returns to signal successful termination. This eliminates the need to always end the \texttt{main} function with a \texttt{return 0;} statement as is common practise in C. A future ambition is to make use of and possibly contribute to the \texttt{grind} tool which moves variable declarations closer to their usage, and thus improving readability of the code.
