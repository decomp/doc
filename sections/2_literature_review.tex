% === [ Literature Review ] ====================================================

% <howto>
% * Critical review of relevant literature
%    - Not just what others have said, but also critique and reflect

% <howto> Doing a literature review
% * Define the problem
% * Literature search
% * Literature review
%    - Read and evaluate the literature
%    - Critically analyse what you have found
% * More than one iteration (continue throughout the project)

% <howto> suggested review approaches
% * Thematic
%    - explain about area of study: general review of area, concentrating on
%      academic literature
% * More focused
%    - e.g. some recent developments in the field
% * Chronological
%    - how the topic has evolved (but beware palaeontology)
% * Alternative theories and methods and explanation why they are relevant
% * SHORT overview of relevant tools

% <howto> literature search
% * Start broad, then focus
% * Redefine/refine search
%    - Continuous cycle: identify different thinking in the area

% <howto> marking notes
% * Uses credible, current material
% * Demonstrates understanding of complex subject and viewed in wider context
% * Shows originality and confidence in criticising assumptions
% * Well-justified critique of literature
% * Identifies flaws, gaps or inconsistencies in extant knowledge

% <howto>
% * What is the problem, or research question that my literature review helps to
%   define?
% * What is the scope of my literature review?
% * Has my search been wide enough to ensure I've found all the relevant
%   material and narrow enough to exclude irrelevant material?
% * Have I critically analysed the literature I use? Do I follow through a set
%   of concepts and questions, comparing items to each other in the ways they
%   deal with them? Instead of just listing and summarizing items, do I assess
%   them, discussing strengths and weaknesses?
% * IMPORTANT: Have I cited and discussed studies contrary to my perspective?

% <howto>
% * Write brief notes on each source (your own words, not their abstract):
%    - Key ideas (seminal sources, recognized theories)
%    - Novel ideas (proposed or demonstrated)
%    - Actual data (as distinct from mere argument)
%    - Outliers (contradict what everyone else says)
%    - Your critical evaluation: Is it convincing? Why? What are its
%      limitations? Is it current or out-of-date? What does it fail to address?

% <howto> common mistakes in writing a literature review
% * Writing your own opinion on a particular subject
% * Writing a list of summaries of sources , one after another, without
%   reviewing it
% * Writing an essay on everything you know about a particular subject

% <howto> What is a literature review?
% * A critical look at the published work relevant to your project
% * Gives the reader understanding of the problem area and the rationale for
%   what you are doing
% * What has already been done in your area
% * Sets the context for your project
% * Justifies your project

% <howto>
% * Main themes and key authors

% <howto>
% * a literature review is NOT an essay.
%    - NOT a detailed write up of a particular source.
%    - NOT just a summary of articles, texts or journals.
%    - NOT an opinionated or argumentative essay.
%
% --- [ essay ] ---
% * Use material to prove an argument or point of view, demonstrate
%   understanding.
% * Use relevant material.
% * Mentions authors/researchers only for reference.

% --- [ literature review ] ---
%
% * Critical analysis of material discovered about a subject.
% * Examine what has already been discovered.
% * Find patterns, gaps, conflicts.
% * Identify key researchers.
%
% * critical appraisal: the ability to apply principles of analysis to identify
%   unbiased and valid work.

% <howto>
% * What to notice when reading
%     - What is the line of reasoning?
%     - Is evidence presented? Does it stand up? (valid criteria)
%     - What do I think about it? Do I agree? Have I found supporting /
%       contradicting material?
%     - Are there assumptions / hidden agendas?
%     - What are the writer's conclusions? Does the evidence support them?
%     - Do not just select the parts of the literature that agree with what you
%       think

% <howto>
% * which authors support which views?
% * are there inconsistencies, gaps...?

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature_review}

This section details the problem domain associated with decompilation, reviews traditional decompilation techniques, and evaluates a set of intermediate representations with regards to their suitability for decompilation purposes. To set the stage for binary analysis, a \textit{``hello world''} executable is dissected in section~\ref{sec:lit_review_the_anatomy_of_an_executable}.
