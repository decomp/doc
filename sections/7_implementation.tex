% === [ Implementation ] =======================================================

% <howto>
% * Write the implementation chapter plot heavy (as a novel)
%    - Problem/task
%    - What happened?
%    - How was is solved?
%
% * If the artefact is not capable of doing everything that was wanted.
%     - Describe problems and reflect on how those problems where solved.
%
% * NOT screenshot (should go in appendix)
%
% * Process of development.
%
% * These are the descitions I made and why.
% * There are interesting problems and here is how I went about solving them.
% * Not just what, but why you did something. What my choices were and why I
%   choose the specific one.
%
% * In the course of the development some changes were made to the design.
% * In the process of doing the implementation, this was the initial design, and
%   these changes had to be made.
%
% Supervisor:
%    - What was this for, why did you do that?

% * Which limitations are tied to the design, and which were caused by the implementation? Describe each one in their dedicated sections.

% * Captivative reading
%    - Make the reading captivating; e.g. Dan Brown. And then X, and then Y.
%    - And then I had a problem, and what did I do about it; which lead to these Z.

% * Note from Janka: The Implementation section should be strictly related to the software itself.


\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section motivates the language choice of the decompilation pipeline, describes the implementation process, and provides insight into how the software artefacts evolved from the challenges that were encountered.
