\subsection{LLVM IR Library}
\label{sec:llvm_ir_library}

% TODO: Mention that the LLVM IR library is incomplete. Only the lexer is complete, support for constants and types is partial. Parsing support is being implemented.

% TODO: <note> incorporate inconsistencies: ref llvm_inconsistencies.txt

% TODO: Add design notes
%    - The LLVM IR libraries are developed as reusable components for compilers, decompilers, and other semantic analysis tools. They aim to support generic semantic analysis applications, while satisfying the explicit requirements [1] of the third party llgo compiler.
