% === [ Implementation ] =======================================================

% <howto>
% * Write the implementation chapter plot heavy (as a novel)
%    - Problem/task
%    - What happened?
%    - How was is solved?
%
% * If the artifact isn't capable of doing everything that was wanted.
%     - Describe problems and reflect on how those problems where solved.
%
% * NOT screenshot (should go in appendix)
%
% * Process of development.
%
% * These are the descitions I made and why.
% * There are interesting problems and here is how I went about solving them.
% * Not just what, but why you did something. What my choices were and why I
%   choose the specific one.
%
% * In the course of the development some changes were made to the design.
% * In the process of doing the implementation, this was the initial design, and
%   these changes had to be made.
%
% Supervisor:
%    - What was this for, why did you do that?

% * Captivative reading
%    - Make the reading captivating; e.g. Dan Brown. And then X, and then Y.
%    - And then I had a problem, and what did I do about it; which lead to these Z.

% TODO: Add? Formal IR
% * No Formal Grammar for LLVM IR
% * Look for other people who has done work in this field
% 	- Reed Koter (MIPS), https://code.google.com/p/llvm-assembly-language-formal-specification/
% * Collaborate on the Formal Grammar.

% TODO: Note from Janka: The Implementation section should be strictly related to the software itself.

% TODO: Brainstorm about which sections are actually relevant and how they should be structured.

% TODO: Mention the following trivias:
%    - Identify unused tokens (hash and backspace) in the C++ code base and submit a patch which was commited to remove these. (http://reviews.llvm.org/D7248)
%    - Discuss API design with members of the open source community.
%    - Ask experienced LLVM developers of insight into possible inconsistencies with LLVM IR. Some highlighted inconsistent behaviour and some were intended behaviour. (LLVM-dev mailing list)
