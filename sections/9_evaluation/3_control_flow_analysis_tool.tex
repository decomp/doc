\subsection{Control Flow Analysis Tool}

In total two essential (\textbf{R20} and \textbf{R21}) requirements were identified for the control flow analysis tool (see section \ref{sec:req_control_flow_analysis_tool}).

The control flow analysis component (see section \ref{sec:design_control_flow_analysis}) satisfies both requirements (not counting future requirements); as summarized in table \ref{tbl:eval_summary_of_control_flow_analysis_tool}. Section \ref{sec:eval_control_flow_analysis_tool_essential_requirements} provides a detailed evaluation of the essential requirements.

			Sat. & Req. & Priority & Description \\

			Yes & \textbf{R20} & MUST & Identify high-level control flow primitives in LLVM IR \\
			\rowcolor{light_green_3}
			Yes & \textbf{R21} & MUST & Support language-agnostic interaction with other components \\
