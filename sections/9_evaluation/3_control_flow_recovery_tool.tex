\subsection{Control Flow Recovery Tool}

In total two essential (\textbf{R20} and \textbf{R21}) requirements were identified for the control flow recovery tool (see section~\ref{sec:req_control_flow_recovery_tool}).

The control flow analysis component (see section~\ref{sec:design_control_flow_analysis}) satisfies both requirements (not counting future requirements); as summarised in table~\ref{tbl:eval_summary_of_control_flow_recovery_tool}. Section~\ref{sec:eval_control_flow_recovery_tool_essential_requirements} provides a detailed evaluation of the essential requirements.
