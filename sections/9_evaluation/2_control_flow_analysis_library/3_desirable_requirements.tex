% * R16 - Recover multi-exit loops

Implementation strategies for desirable requirements were only considered as time permitted. The support for multi-exit loops (\textbf{R16}) was intentionally omitted from this release, to allocate time for the essential requirements. More research is required to determine how the current design of the control flow analysis stage may be refined to support the recovery of multi-exit loops.

% * R17 - Recover nested loops

The successful decompilation of nested loops (\textbf{R17}) is demonstrated in appendix \ref{app:decompilation_of_nested_primitives}, which provides a contrived example that implicitly uses the same decompilation steps as described above. The final Go output, which is presented on the right side of figure \ref{fig:nested_comparison} in appendix \ref{app:decompilation_of_nested_primitives}, contains nested \texttt{for}-loops (one inner loop and one outer loop), thus proving that nested loops may be recovered.
