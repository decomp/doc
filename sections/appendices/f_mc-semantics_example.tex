\subsection{MC-Semantics Example}
\label{app:mc-semantics_example}

The MC-Semantics project may be used to translate native code into LLVM IR. Using MC-Semantics, the x86 assembly (presented in figure \ref{lst:example1_asm}) of a 32-bit ELF object code file was decompiled into the LLVM IR assembly presented in figure \ref{lst:example1_mcsema_ll}. An intermediate step of the translation process produced a serialized CFG (in Google Protocol Buffer format) of the native code, which has been obmitted from the example listings for the sake of brevity.
