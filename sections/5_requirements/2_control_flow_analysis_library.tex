% --- [ Control Flow Analysis Library ] ----------------------------------------

\subsection{Control Flow Analysis Library}

A decision was made early on to only support decompilation of compiler generated code from structured high-level languages (\textbf{R9}). Support for arbitrary, unstructured and obfuscated code has been intentionally omitted (\textbf{R17}) to avoid a myriad of special cases.

The control flow analysis library must recover the high-level control flow primitives of pre-test loops (\textbf{R10}), infinite loops (\textbf{R11}) and 2-way conditionals (\textbf{R12}), as these are found in virtually every high-level language today \cite{reverse_comp}. Post-test loops (\textbf{R13}) and n-way conditionals (\textbf{R14}) are also common - but not found in every language (e.g. Python has no \texttt{switch} statements and Go has no \texttt{do-while} loops) - and should therefore be recovered. Support for multi-exit loops (\textbf{R15}) and nested loops (\textbf{R16}) could be included if time permits. The recovery of compound boolean expressions is intentionally deferred (\textbf{R18}) as it would require analysis of instructions within basic blocks in addition to the CFG analysis.
