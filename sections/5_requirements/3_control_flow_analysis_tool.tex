\subsection{Control Flow Analysis Tool}
\label{sec:req_control_flow_analysis_tool}

The primary intention of this project is to create self-contained components which may be used in the decompilation pipelines of other projects. It is therefore of vital importance that the components are able to interact with tools written in other programming languages (\textbf{R21}). The control flow analysis tool is one such component which aims to recover a set of high-level control flow primitives from LLVM IR (\textbf{R20}).
