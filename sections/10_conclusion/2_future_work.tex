\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

% TODO: Check that tertiary means what I think it does.

The primary focus for planned future work is to stress test the design of the decompilation pipeline and its individual components. A secondary focus is to improve the quality and the reliability of the components. A tertiary focus is to extend the capabilities of the decompilation pipeline. This prioritization strives to validate the core of the system before extending it.

The principle of separation of concern has influenced every aspect of the design of the decompilation pipeline and its individual components. Conceptually, the components of the decompilation pipeline are grouped into three modules which separate concerns regarding the source language (front-end module), the general decompilation tasks (middle-end module), and the target language (back-end module). This conceptual separation is a vital aspect of the decompilation pipeline design, and it will therefore be thoroughly examined. Should a component violate the principle of separation of concern, either in isolation or within the system as a whole, it must be redesigned or reimplemented. To identify such issues, key areas of the decompilation pipeline will be extended to put pressure on the design.

% TODO: Check spelling and use of leverage (in this context).

Firstly, an additional back-end (e.g. support for Python as a target language) will be implemented to put pressure on the design of the middle-end module. The second back-end would only be able to leverage the target-independent information of the general decompilation tasks (e.g. control flow analysis) if the middle-end module was implemented correctly.

Secondly, a key component (e.g. data flow analysis) will be implemented in separate programming language (e.g. Haskell, Rust, Prolog, …) to validate the language-agnostic aspects of the design. This component would only be able to interact with the rest of the decompilation pipeline, through well-defined input and output (e.g. LLVM IR, JSON, DOT, …), if the other components were implemented correctly.

% TODO: Reformulate the following paragraph.

The only interaction between the front-end module and the middle-end module is through an intermediate representation (LLVM IR), thus clearly separating them from one another. Furthermore, a variety of source languages are already supported by the front-end which consists of several independent open source project (e.g. Dagger, Fracture, MC-Semantic, Clang, …).



























% TODO: Add notes from decomp.org/ll2go/IDEAS.txt.
%    - grind
% TODO: Add footnote to rsc's grind tool.

% * Finish developing the LLVM IR library and replace the C++ binding with a pure Go implementation. This should decrese build times significantly and simplify the overall complexity of the project by several orders of magnitude.

% * Formal Grammar for a subset of LLVM IR
%    - Mention previous (partial but incomplete) work.

% * Third Party Adaptation

% TODO: Fuzz the LLVM IR parser by generating valid LLVM from the EBNF grammar (similar to gosmith).

% TODO: Investigate various ways to mitigate the limitations of the control flow analysis design.
