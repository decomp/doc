\subsection{Future Work}

% TODO: Add notes from IDEAS.txt.
%    - grind

% * Finish developing the LLVM IR library and replace the C++ binding with a pure Go implementation. This should decrese build times significantly and simplify the overall complexity of the project by several orders of magnitude.

% * Formal Grammar for a subset of LLVM IR
%    - Mention previous (partial but incomplete) work.

% * Third Party Adaptation

% * Data Flow Analysis.

% TODO: Proof-of-concept. Implement a back-end for another language and written in another language. This would stress test the language-agnostic aspects of the design, thus making sure that the heavy-lifting is done in the middle-end and not in ll2go.

% TODO: Add ref to rsc's grind tool.

% * Stress test the design by implementing another back-end written in and for another programming language.

% TODO: Fuzz the LLVM IR parser by generating valid LLVM from the EBNF grammar (similar to gosmith).
