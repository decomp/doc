\subsection{Personal Development}

This is the largest project I have undertaken in my life and I feel satisfied with the outcome and proud of what I have been able to accomplished. It has re-enforced my belief that any problem is solvable when broken into smaller subproblems and instilled me with a feeling that anything is possible. The project has allowed me to mature as a software engineer and I now feel more confident in utilizing best practies such as TDD, CI and semantic versioning. I have also matured as a developer and gained experience with implementing a semi-large project and structuring it into several smaller self-contained projects.
