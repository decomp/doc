\subsection{Final Thoughts}

My happiest moment during the project was when the larger components started working and could be connected to form a complete system. It feels great having started out with a vague idea of how the decompiler could work, gradually gaining new insights and refining its design after researching and building on the knowledge of others, developing and iteratively reimplementing the various components until they felt just right, finally arriving at a working prototype and seeing the full system in action! If there is one key idea I want to leave you with it is that the composition of independent components, each with a single purpose and well-defined input and output, is a powerful concept for solving complex problems.
