\subsection{Native Code to LLVM IR}
\label{sec:rel_work_native_code_to_llvm_ir}

There exists several open source projects for translating native code (e.g. x86, ARM) into LLVM IR. This section presents three such projects; Dagger, Fracture and MC-Semantics. The Fracture project is still in early development (e.g. recursive descent disassembler is on the roadmap), but shows a lot of promise and is currently capable of translating ARM binaries into LLVM IR \cite{fracture}. The Dagger and Fracture projects are reviewed in section \ref{sec:rel_work_dagger} and \ref{sec:rel_work_mc-semantics}, respectively.
