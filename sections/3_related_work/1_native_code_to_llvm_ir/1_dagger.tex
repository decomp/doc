\subsubsection{Dagger}

The Dagger project is a fork of the LLVM compiler framework, which provides a component for translating native code into LLVM IR, and extends the capabilities of the disassembly library by implementing support for recursive descent parsing (see section \ref{sec:lit_review_disassembly}). Some of these changes have been submitted upstream and merged into the LLVM project.

The LLVM compiler framework defines a platform-independent representation of low-level machine instructions called \texttt{MCInst}, which describes the semantics of native instructions. For each supported architecture (e.g. x86) there
