\subsubsection{MC-Semantics}

Dagger and MC-Semantics uses a structure to keep track of all registers and passes a pointer to this structure as an argument to each function. Reads from and writes to registers are made using loads and stores.

With proper use-def chains the *input* and *output* of a function could be made apparent, removing the need to pass the entire structure to each function. Registers could be passed by value as parameters which would facilitate several optimization passes.

% Dagger and Fracture rely on TableGen for instruction semantics, McSema does not.
