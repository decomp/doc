\subsubsection{C-Decompiler}

The \texttt{C-Decompiler} translates machine code into C source code. It focuses primarily on improving the readability of the generated C source code, and does so by extending the traditional decompilation techniques outlined by Cristina Cifuentes in three ways. Firstly, the data flow analysis phase is refined using a shadow stack, which corresponds to a virtual stack capable of tracking stack variables and updates to the stack pointer register. Secondly, the register propagation algorithms are adapted to handle use-def chains across multiple basic blocks. Lastly, library signatures are generated for the C++ Standard Template Library \cite{readable_c_decomp}.
