The Interactive Disassembler (IDA) and the Hex-Rays decompiler are the de facto tools used in industry for binary analysis, malware forensics and reverse engineering \cite{semantics_preserving_structural_analysis}. The interactive capabilities of IDA enables users to guide the disassembler through non-trivial problems (e.g. anti-disassembly techniques used by malware) related to the disassembly phase, some of which have been outlined in section \ref{sec:lit_review_disassembly} \cite{hexrays}. This approach turns out to be very powerful, as it is facilitated by human ingenuity and problem solving skills.
