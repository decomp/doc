\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

The requirements of each deliverable have been outlined in the succeeding subsections, and are categorized using MoSCoW prioritization \cite{MoSCoW_analysis}; a definition of which is presented in table \ref{tbl:MoSCoW_priorities}. Each requirement is directly related to an objective as indicated by the requirements tables of the deliverables. The only objective not covered is objective \ref{itm:obj_data_analysis_library} which was intentionally left as a future ambition.

			WON'T & A future requirement that \textit{will not} be satisfied in this release \\
