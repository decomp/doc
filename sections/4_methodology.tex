\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

No single methodology was used for this project, but rather a combination of software development techniques (such as test-driven development and continuous integration) which have been shown to work well in practice for other open source projects. This project has been developed in the open from day one, using public source code repositories and issue trackers. To encourage open source adaptation, the software artefacts and the project report have been released into the public domain, and are made available on GitHub; as further described in section~\ref{sec:intro_deliverables}. Throughout the course of the project a public discussion has been held with other members of the open source community to clarify the requirements and validate the design of the LLVM IR library, and to investigate inconsistent behaviours in the LLVM reference implementation; as described in section~\ref{sec:impl_llvm_ir_library}.
