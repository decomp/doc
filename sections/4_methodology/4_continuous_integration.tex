% --- [ Continuous Integration ] -----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Continuous Integration}

The Continuous Integration (CI) practise originated from the Extreme Programming methodology \cite{extreme_programming} but has reached a much broader audience in recent years. Today most large scale software projects rely on CI server farms to continuously compile and test new versions of the source code. This project makes heavy use of CI, as further described in section \ref{sec:ver_continuous_integration}.
