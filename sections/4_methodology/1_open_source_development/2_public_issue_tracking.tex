% --- [ Public Issue Tracking ] ------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Public Issue Tracking}

% TODO: Add
%    - The project plan will be organized using the GitHub issue tracker, where each issue corresponds to a task. Milestones, containing a set of issues, will track the progress of the project and enforce deadlines.
%    - To facilitate time management each task will be tracked using the GitHub issue tracker, and larger tasks will be divided into suitably sized sub-tasks. The smaller sub-tasks help maintain focus and make it easier to establish reasonable deadlines.

% TODO: Add project plan?
%    - The project plan will be managed using the GitHub issue tracker, and actively maintained throughout the project. Each task (research topic, unresolved problem, software feature, etc) will be allocated a dedicated issue tracking its progress. The issues include relevant discussions of identified risks, potential problems and proposed solutions. The project plan provides an overview of the active issues, using milestones to group issues and assign deadlines.

% TODO: <note> remove?
% * It is important to decide at the start of the project on the tasks to be carried out (to develop the artefact and to write the report), when they will take place and how long they should take.
%   - It is also essential that you monitor your progress through the project, and show evidence of monitoring in the report.

% TODO: <note> remove?
% * Make a rough project plan; before 26 sep.
%    - Make use of GitHub issues and milestones with deadlines to track development.
