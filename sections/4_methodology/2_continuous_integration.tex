% --- [ Continuous Integration ] -----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Continuous Integration}

The Continuous Integration (CI) practice originated from the Extreme Programming methodology \cite{extreme_programming} but has reached a much broader audience in recent years. Today most large scale software projects rely on CI server farms to continuously compile and test new versions of the source code. This project makes heavy use of CI to monitor the build status, test cases and code coverage of each software artefact, as further described in section \ref{sec:ver_continuous_integration}.
