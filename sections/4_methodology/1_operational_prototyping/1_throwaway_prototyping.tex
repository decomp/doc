\subsubsection{Throwaway Prototyping}
\label{sec:method_throwaway_prototyping}

Throwaway prototyping may be used in the early stages of development to gain insight into a problem domain, by rapidly implementing \textit{throw away} prototypes which will be discarded upon completion. These prototypes aim to challenge design decisions, stress test implementation strategies, identify further research requirements, and provide a better understanding and intuition for the problem domain and potential solutions. Throwaway prototypes are developed in an informal manner and are not intended to become part of the final artefact. This allows rapid iterations, as several areas of quality software (e.g. maintainability, efficiency and usability) may be ignored. When utilized appropriately, throwaway prototyping makes the development very time effective as costly changes are applied early on \cite{operational_prototyping}.

% TODO: Remove all of the below comments?

% quick-and-dirty throwaway prototypes to gain an understanding of the requirements and an insight into the problem domain.

% rapid prototypes on top of a solid evolutionary base.

% * Build prototypes quickly, used for experimentation.
% * Implements requirements that are poorly understood. (why build a prototype that is already understood, only to throw it away?)
% * Discarded after the desired information is learned.

% After developing the prototype the developer incorporates what was learned. Works well in isolation to verify relatively small parts of complex problems.
