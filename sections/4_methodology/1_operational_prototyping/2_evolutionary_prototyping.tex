\subsubsection{Evolutionary Prototyping}
\label{sec:method_evolutionary_prototyping}

Evolutionary prototyping focuses on implementing the parts of the system which are well understood, as acknowledged by the quote from A. Davis presented in figure \ref{fig:evolutionary_prototyping}. This is in direct contrast to throwaway prototyping (see section \ref{sec:method_throwaway_prototyping}), which aims to provide insight into the requirements of the poorly understood parts of the system. From the initial implementation, evolutionary prototypes are built as robust systems which evolve over time. The evolutionary prototypes may lack functionliaty, but the functionality they implement is generally of high enough quality to be used in production systems \cite{operational_prototyping}.
