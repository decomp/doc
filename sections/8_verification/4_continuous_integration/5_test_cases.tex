\subsubsection{Test Cases}

Travis CI has been configured to run the test cases for each component with race detection\footnote{Introducing the Go Race Detector: \url{https://blog.golang.org/race-detector}} enabled. This may help identify data races, which occur when concurrent code read from and write to the same memory locations.
