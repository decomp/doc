\subsubsection{Test Cases}

Travis CI has been configured to run the test cases for each component with race detection\footnote{Introducing the Go Race Detector: \url{https://blog.golang.org/race-detector}} enabled. In addition to monitoring the status of test cases, this may help identify data race conditions which occur when concurrent code read from and write to the same memory locations.
