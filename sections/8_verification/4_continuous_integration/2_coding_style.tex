\subsubsection{Coding Style}

Best practices for writing effective Go code have been outlined in the \textit{Effective Go}\footnote{Effective Go: \url{https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html}} and \textit{Go Code Review Comments}\footnote{Go Code Review Comments: \url{http://golang.org/wiki/CodeReviewComments}} documents. They supplement the Go language specification and describe a set of idioms and conventions used in idiomatic Go code. Great care has been taken to follow these principles when developing, and a CI test has been integrated which utilizes the \texttt{golint}\footnote{Golint is a linter for Go source code: \url{https://github.com/golang/lint}} tool to automatically detect and report issues related to coding style (e.g. naming, documentation and error message conventions).
