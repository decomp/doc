\subsection{Test Cases}

As stated by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1969, \textit{``testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.''} \cite{absence_of_bugs_quote} For this reason, several independent methods were utilized to verify the correctness of the decompilation components and their utility libraries, including the automatic generation of C programs (with a large number of nested \texttt{if}-statements) which were used to stress test each component of the decompilation pipeline; as further described in section \ref{sec:ver_performance}.

A lot of thought went into designing test cases which attempt to break the code, exploit assumptions, and exercise tricky corner cases (e.g. no whitespace between tokens in LLVM IR). These tests were often written prior to the implementation of the software artefacts, to reduce the risk of testing what was built rather than what was intended to be built (as specified by the requirements). The test cases have successfully identified a large number of bugs in the software artefacts, and even uncovered inconsistent behaviour in the reference implementation of the LLVM IR lexer; as further described in section \ref{sec:impl_llvm_ir_library}. To facilitate extensibility, the test cases were often implemented using a table driven design which separate the test case data from the test case implementation.

An extract of the test cases used to verify the candidate discovery logic, the equation solver and the candidate validation logic of the subgraph isomorphism search library is presented in figure \ref{fig:iso_test_cases}. These test cases are automatically executed by the CI service any time a new change is commited to the source code repository, as further described in section \ref{sec:ver_continuous_integration}.
