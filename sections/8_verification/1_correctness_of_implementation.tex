\subsection{Correctness of Implementation}

% * Test corner cases as they are often the cause of software bugs [x]; such as
%   off-by-one issues and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
% * Where feasible test all possible inputs; e.g. uint8.

As stated by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1969, \textit{``testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.''} \cite{absence_of_bugs_quote} For this reason, several independent methods were utilized to verify the correctness of the decompilation components and their utility libraries. A lot of thought went into designing test cases which exercise tricky corner cases (e.g. no whitespace between tokens)
