% <systematic>
% * Replace double-quotes with back-ticks and apostrophes.
%    - "foo" -> ``foo''
% * American spelling -> British spelling
%    - prioritized -> prioritised?
%    - specialized -> specialised?
%    - practise vs. practice?
%    ### RUN ack z
% * Always make use of acronyms once they have been defined, unless:
%    - They are part of a section header.
%    - They are part of a name (e.g. use "control flow graph generation tool" instead of "CFG generation tool").
% * Acronyms:
%    - "control flow analysis" -> "CFG"
% * Misuse of where instead of were.
% * Strip "s" suffix from the accompanying verbs of plural nouns.
%    - "formats differs" -> "formats differ"
%    - "files consists" -> "files consist"
% * Pronouns (e.g. "it") may cause ambiguity, if so be more specific; e.g.
%    - "The .rela.plt section specifies the relocation entities of the PLT; more specifically it informs the linker ..." -> "The .rela.plt section specifies the relocation entities of the PLT; more specifically this section informs the linker ..."
% * Use a comma after dependent clauses at start of sentence; e.g.
%    - "In general ELF files" -> "In general, ELF files"
%    - "Therefore the program headers" -> "Therefore, the program headers"
%    - "Lastly the back-end translates" -> "Lastly, the back-end translates"
%    - "Rather than working with sequential lists the control flow analysis algorithms will" -> "Rather than working with sequential lists, the control flow analysis algorithms will"
%    - "To facilitate the implementation and debugging of these algorithms a visual representation" -> "To facilitate the implementation and debugging of these algorithms, a visual representation"
% * Search for broken refs; i.e. search for "??" and invoke texi2pdf and check for warnings.
% * Search for \ref{foo} and replace with real reference.
% * Search for \footnote{foo} and replace with real footnote.
% * Search for "see \ref"

% <howto>
% * Critically evaluate why you are doing things, throughout the entire report.

% TODO: Use British and not American English:
%    * File content vs file contents -> prefer file contents.
%    * Don't use apostrophes I've -> I have. It's -> it is or it has.
%    * Add apostrophe to idea?
% TODO: Consistency
%    * Use control flow instead of control-flow.
% TODO: Proof read for common mistakes:
%    * exist vs exists.
% TODO: Fix LaTeX style and encoding issues:
%    * Replace "foo" with ``foo''

% TODO: Content check list:
%    - text answers the central question
%    - main line of argument is clear
%    - sufficient weight given to most important points

% TODO: update Git revision in the footnotes of the eval section.

% TODO: Check that the requirements are correctly references; e.g. not using
% \textbf{R11} when intending to refer to requirement 12.
% TODO: Try once more to find a clean solution for implementing custom labels,
% as this would resolve the aforementioned issue of mismatching requirements.
