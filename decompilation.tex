% === [ Introduction ] =========================================================

\section{Introduction}

% --- [ Background ] -----------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Background}

A compiler is a piece of software which translates human readable high-level
programming languages (e.g. C) to machine readable low-level languages (e.g.
Assembly). In the usual flow of compilation, code is lowered through a set of
transformations from a high-level to a low-level representation. This paper
introduces the concept of decompilation (originally referred to as reverse
compilation \cite{rev_comp}) which moves in the opposite direction by lifting
code from a low-level to a high-level representation.

% TODO: Find a good place to write about the applications of decompilation;
%    automated vuln audit \cite{vuln_audit}, etc.

% --- [ Project Aim and Objectives ] -------------------------------------------

\subsection{Project Aim and Objectives}

The aim of this project is to facilitate decompilation workflows using
composition of language-agnostic decompilation passes; specifically the
reconstruction of high-level control structures and, as a future ambition,
expressions.

In order to achieve this aim, the author will:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Review traditional decompilation techniques, including control flow
analysis and data flow analysis.
	\item Critically evaluate a set of Intermediate Representations (IR), which
describes low-, medium- and high-level language semantics, to identify one or
more suitable for the decompilation pipeline.
	\item Analyze the formal grammar (language specification) of the IR to verify
that it is unambiguous. If the grammar is ambiguous or if no formal grammar
exists, produce a formal grammar. This objective is critical for
language-independence, as the IR works as a bridge between different programming
languages.
	\item Determine if any existing library for the IR satisfies our
requirements; and if not develop one. The requirements would include a suitable
in-memory representation, and support for on-disk file storage and arbitrary
manipulations (inject, delete, etc) of the IR.
	\item Design and develop components which identify the structural patterns of
high-level control structures using control flow analysis of the IR.
	\item Develop tools which perform one or more decompilation passes on a given
IR. The tools will be reusable by other programming language environments as
their input and output is specified by a formally defined IR.
	\item As a future ambition, design and develop components which perform
expression propagation using data flow analysis of the IR.
\end{enumerate}

% --- [ Decompilation Phases ] -------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Decompilation Phases}

A core principle utilized in decompilers is the separation of concern through the use of abstractions, and a lot of work involves translating into and breaking out of various abstraction layers. In general a decompiler is composed of distinct phases which parses, analyzes or transforms the input. These phases are conceptually grouped into three modules to separate concerns regarding source machine language and target programming language. The front-end module parses object files and translates their platform dependent assembly into a platform independent intermediate representation (IR). The middle-end module performs a set of decompilation passes to lift the IR, from a low-level to a high-level representation, by reconstruction high-level control structures and expressions. Finally the back-end module translates the high-level IR to a specific target programming language. Figure \ref{overview} gives an overview of the decompilation modules and visualizes their relationship.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\caption{The front-end module accepts several object file formats (PE, ELF, …) as input and translates their platform dependent assembly (x86, ARM, …) to a low-level IR. The middle-end module then lifts the low-level IR to a high-level IR through a set of decompilation passes. Finally the backend-module translates the high-level IR into one of several target programming languages (C, Go, Python, …).}
