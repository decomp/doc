# The decomp.org Project

This repository acts as an umbrella for the decomp.org project, which implements a decompilation pipeline through the composition of independent [decompilation components](https://github.com/decomp). High-level design plans, ideas and random brainstorming about future decompilation stages are discussed in the [issue tracker].

**NOTE**: The source code of this project has been released into the [public domain] and is made available at [github.com/decomp](https://github.com/decomp).

## Contribution

Anyone with an interest in the decomp.org project is encouraged to contribute in whichever way they desire. This may include:

* Critically evaluate the design of the decompilation components, both current and future ones. Suggest design ideas for new decompilation stages, and highlight limitations with the design of the current ones. Design discussions are taking place in the [issue tracker].
* Contribute ideas and participate in collective brainstorming regarding decompilation strategies. Together we may create a *decompilation think tank*! Random decompilation ideas are discussed in the [issue tracker].
* Participate in the development of any of the independent [decompilation components](https://github.com/decomp).
    - [ll2dot](https://github.com/decomp/ll2dot) - control flow graph generation (e.g. *.ll -> *.dot).
    - [graphs](https://github.com/decomp/graphs) - control flow analysis (i.e. subgraph isomorphism search algorithms)
    - [restructure](https://github.com/decomp/restructure) - control flow recovery (e.g. *.dot -> *.json)
    - [ll2go](https://github.com/decomp/ll2go) - code generation (e.g. *.ll -> *.go)
    - [go-post](https://github.com/decomp/go-post) - post processing (e.g. unpolished Go -> polished Go)
* Implement any of the existing [decompilation components](https://github.com/decomp) in a new programming language! Just because they are currently written in Go, does not mean that Go is necessarily the best choice for each task.
    - Maybe C++ would be a more natural choice for [control flow graph generation](https://github.com/decomp/ll2dot)?
    - Maybe the pattern matching capabilities of Haskell would produce beautiful [control flow analysis](https://github.com/decomp/graphs) and [control flow recovery](https://github.com/decomp/restructure) components?
* Extend the middle-end of the decompilation pipeline by developing new components in a well suited language for the task.
    - [Type analysis](https://github.com/decomp/decompilation/labels/type%20analysis)
        + Maybe use a constraint programming language (e.g. Prolog)?
    - Data flow analysis
        + Which language may be well suited for this task and why?
* Implement back-ends to add support for new target programming languages (e.g. Python, C, ...).
    - Any language with libraries for interacting with LLVM IR and JSON may be a good choice. Often it feels natural to develop a back-end in the same language it targets (i.e. a Python back-end developed in Python), but other languages may work just as well (e.g. [use Haskell to populate a Python AST](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-python-0.4.1/docs/Language-Python-Common-AST.html)).
* Help improve the quality of the [decompilation components](https://github.com/decomp) by submitting bug reports, usability issues or feature requests.
* ...
* Any other ideas? Feel free to join the project and contribute however you desire!

### Abstract

Decompilation or reverse compilation is the process of translating low-level machine-readable code into high-level human-readable code. The problem is non-trivial due to the amount of information lost during compilation, but it can be divided into several smaller problems which may be solved independently. This report explores the feasibility of composing a decompilation pipeline from independent components, and the potential of exposing those components to the end-user. The components of the decompilation pipeline are conceptually grouped into three modules. Firstly, the front-end translates a source language (e.g. x86 assembly) into LLVM IR; a platform-independent low-level intermediate representation. Secondly, the middle-end structures the LLVM IR by identifying high-level control flow primitives (e.g. pre-test loops, 2-way conditionals). Lastly, the back-end translates the structured LLVM IR into a high-level target programming language (e.g. Go). The control flow analysis stage of the middle-end uses subgraph isomorphism search algorithms to locate control flow primitives in CFGs, both of which are described using Graphviz DOT files.

The decompilation pipeline has been proven capable of recovering nested pre-test and post-test loops (e.g. `while`, `do-while`), and 1-way and 2-way conditionals (e.g. `if`, `if-else`) from LLVM IR. Furthermore, the data-driven design of the control flow analysis stage facilitates extensions to identify new control flow primitives. There is huge potential for future development. The Go output could be made more idiomatic by extending the post-processing stage, using components such as Grind by Russ Cox which moves variable declarations closer to their usage. The language-agnostic aspects of the design will be validated by implementing components in other languages; e.g. data flow analysis in Haskell. Additional back-ends (e.g. Python output) will be implemented to verify that the general decompilation tasks (e.g. control flow analysis, data flow analysis) are handled by the middle-end.
