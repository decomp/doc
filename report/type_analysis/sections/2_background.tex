\section{Background}

This section provides a brief background on important terminology and concepts related to type analysis and binary analysis.

To help explain different aspects of variable recovery and type analysis, two running examples are used throughout this paper. The first example (see figure \ref{fig:local_variable_example} of appendix \ref{app:local_variable_example}) details a function \texttt{f} which allocates local variables on the function stack frame. The second example (see figure \ref{fig:struct_example} of appendix \ref{app:struct_example}) details a function \texttt{g} which operates on an array of structures, and a function \texttt{h} which operates on a structure pointer. Subsequent in-text references to \texttt{f}, \texttt{g} and \texttt{h} correspond to these three functions, and the \texttt{f:12} notation represents a reference to the function \texttt{f} at line number 12 in the source listing.
