\subsection{Future Applications}

Personally, I predict that binary analysis and formal verification of binary executables will be of increasing importance in the future as software continues to be more intimately integrated in the most essential infrastructures of our society. Furthermore, based on Ken Thompson's \textit{Reflections on Trusting Trust} and given the occurrence of tampered binary releases of open source repositories\footnote{Giteabot account was compromised: \url{https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/4167}} these validation efforts must take place not only at source code level, but also at binary executable level.
