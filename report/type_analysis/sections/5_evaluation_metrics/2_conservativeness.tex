% --- [ Conservativeness ] -----------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Conservativeness}

Reports whether the source type exists within the type range (lower and upper bound) of the recovered type.

The distance measurement as defined by TIE did not distinguish between multi-level pointers (e.g. \texttt{int*} and \texttt{int**} are equivalent, i.e. on the same level in the type lattice). Thus SecondWrite proposed a refinement to measure the ratio between the recovered pointer level and the source pointer level \cite{second_write_scalable_type_detection}.

Other metrics have been proposed to compare class hierarchies.
