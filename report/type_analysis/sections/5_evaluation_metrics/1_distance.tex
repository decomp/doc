% --- [ Distance ] -------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Distance}

The distance metric measures the distance in height between the recovered type and the source type in the primitive type lattice (see figure \ref{fig:primitive_type_lattice}). The calculation of distance is meaningful only for subtypes (e.g. \texttt{int32} is a subtype of \texttt{reg32} at distance 2), otherwise the maximum lattice height is used.
