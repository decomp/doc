% --- [ Distance ] -------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Distance}

The distance in height between the recovered and the source type in the primitive type lattice (see figure \ref{fig:base_type_lattice}) for subtypes (e.g. \texttt{int32} is a subtype of \texttt{num32} at distance 1), and the maximum lattice height otherwise.
