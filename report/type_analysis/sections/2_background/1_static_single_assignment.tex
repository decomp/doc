% --- [ Static Single Assignment ] ---------------------------------------------

\subsection{Static Single Assignment}

Static Single Assignment (SSA) form is a property of an intermediate representation (IR) in which each variable is assigned exactly once. SSA-form is commonly used in the IR of compilers as it facilitates data flow analysis and simplifies some optimization passes (e.g. dead code elimination).

% TODO: Reformulate and perhaps move?

Within type analysis, SSA-form help track the live ranges of variables stored in the same register (e.g. \texttt{eax} may be used in the same function for more than one variable, perhaps of distinct types).
