% --- [ Static Analysis ] ------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Static Analysis}

\todo{TODO: describe relevant aspects of static analysis. Covers all code paths but does not known concrete values of pointers, and some techniques of memory graph analysis are thus limited. (Verify if this is actually true, claimed in Type Inference on Executables. However Symbolic execution may mitigate this limitation even in static analysis.)} \cite{type_inference_on_executables}
