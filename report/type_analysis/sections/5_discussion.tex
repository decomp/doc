\todo{TODO: what to include in discussion?}

\subsection{Future Applications}

\todo{TODO: write about formal verification of binary executables} \\
\todo{write about associated benefits, drawbacks, limitations and strengths}

Formally verified output (not just input).

\subsection{Future Research}

\todo{TODO: write about fuzzy logic}

Fuzzy logic (rather than boolean certainty (0 or 1), include fuzzy certainty (0 through 1) of variable type, and refine propagation to take certainty into account).
