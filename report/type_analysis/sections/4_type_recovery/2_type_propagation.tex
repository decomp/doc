\subsection{Type Propagation}

% TODO: Mention that type propagation is part of Flow-based type inference?

Given the relationship between variables -- as determined by data flow analysis -- type constraints may be propagated from available type sources (e.g. instruction and function type sources).

For instance, at \texttt{f:25} (see figure \ref{fig:local_variable_example_asm}) \todo{TODO: continue here}
