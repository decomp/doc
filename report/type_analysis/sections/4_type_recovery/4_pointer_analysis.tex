\subsection{Pointer analysis}

\todo{TODO: give brief introduction to pointer analysis, points-to sets, pointer aliasing, and the technique to merge call sites such that memory allocated at different allocation call sites (e.g. calls to \texttt{malloc}) may have the same type if proven that through type propagation, that the returned pointers are used at other parts of the program for the same variables.}
