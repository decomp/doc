\section{Evaluation Metrics}

To enable objective comparison of different type recovery methods, a set of shared evaluation metrics is required. For this purpose, TIE proposed two evaluation metrics: \textit{distance} and \textit{conservativeness} \cite{tie_reverse_engineering_of_types}. Other research projects have proposed metrics to compare class hierarchies.

For benchmark comparison of different type recovery methods, the open source tools of Coreutils\footnote{Coreutils - GNU core utilities: \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html}} are often used. Executables may be compiled to include debug information as a ground truth for source variables and types. The debug information is only used for validation, and no type recovery method assessed in this essay depend on the information to be available.
