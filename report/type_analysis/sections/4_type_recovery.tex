\section{Type Recovery}

% Key: many problems in binary analysis can be seen as subproblems of type analysis.

% binary analysis,

% floating-point stack
%    - track stack top (indirect calls/external calls)
% pointer analysis
%    - global memory region
%    - stack memory region
%    - heap memory region
% structures/arrays

The key concepts used in type recovery are \textit{type inference}, \textit{type propagation} and \textit{unification} \cite{mycroft_type_based_decompilation}; and their shared representation is \textit{type constraints} (e.g. upper and lower bounds in a primitive type lattice) associated with the variables determined through variable recovery (see section \ref{sec:variable_recovery}).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Type inference infers type constraints of variables (based on the values they may contain, their use in instructions and as function arguments).
	\item Type propagation propagates the type constraints between variables which interact (based on data flow analysis).
	\item Unification unifies the type constraints of the entire program, and may be seen as calculating the set of solutions (which may be empty) to the type constraint equations.
\end{itemize}
