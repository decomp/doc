\subsection{Terminology}

% ~~~ [ Basic Block ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsubsection{Basic Block}

A basic block is a sequence of non-branching instructions terminated by a branching instruction, where incoming branches may only target the first instruction of the basic block and outgoing branches may only leave from the last instruction of the basic block; as illustrated in listing \ref{lst:basic_block}.

% ~~~ [ Control Flow Graph ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsubsection{Control Flow Graph}

A control flow graph $G = (V, E, r)$ is a directed graph rooted at $r$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, where $r$ denotes the entry point of execution, $v \in V$ denotes a basic block and $(u, v) \in E$ denotes the transfer of control of execution from $u$ to $v$. The corresponding control flow graph of the x86 assembly example in listing \ref{lst:basic_block} is presented in figure \ref{fig:control_flow_graph}.

\subsubsection{Closed Path}

A closed path is a path with the same start and end vertex, and a cycle is a closed path with one or more edges.

% ~~~ [ Interval ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsubsection{Interval}

\todo{TODO: Is it valid to replace the term closed path with cycle in the definition of interval?}

An interval $I(h)$ with header node $h$ is a maximal single-entry subgraph in which $h$ is the only entry node and all closed paths contain $h$ \cite{structuring_algorithm_for_decompilation}. The example illustrated in figure \ref{fig:interval} highlights the intervals \textbf{I(B1)}, \textbf{I(B6)}, and \textbf{I(B13)} in a control flow graph.
