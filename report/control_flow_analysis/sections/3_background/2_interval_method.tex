\label{sec:interval_method}

% Reducible control flow graphs are reducible by intervals.

The interval method is a control flow recovery method which identifies the loops in a control flow graph $G$ and determines their type based on the back edges of the intervals of $G$. The nesting levels of loops are determined based on the derived sequence of graphs $G^1 \dots G^n$.
