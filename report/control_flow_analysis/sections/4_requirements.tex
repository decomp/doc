\section{Requirements}

The requirements of each deliverable have been outlined in the succeeding subsections, and are categorised using MoSCoW prioritisation~\cite{MoSCoW_analysis}; a definition of which is presented in table~\ref{tbl:MoSCoW_priorities}. Each requirement is directly related to an objective as indicated by the requirements tables of the deliverables.
