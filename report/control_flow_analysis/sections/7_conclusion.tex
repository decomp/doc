\subsection{Future Research}

As a future research topic, it would be very interesting to combine a variety of control flow recovery methods, and evaluate if they may facilitate each other to further improve control flow recovery.

Additional insights could be provided by a deeper evaluation which examines how the control flow recovery methods deal with irreducible graphs, as produces by various compiler optimisations (e.g. jump threading).
