Control flow recovery is the process of analysing control flow graphs to recover information about the underlying high-level control flow primitives of unstructured machine code or low-level intermediate representations. The applications of control flow recovery are versatile. Among others, it is used within compilers, automated vulnerability scanners and decompilers to enable high-level data flow analysis of IR, facilitate binary analysis and reconstruct structured source code from binary applications. A number of control flow recovery methods have been proposed by the scientific community. However, each method has its respective benefits and drawbacks, and there is no one method that outperforms every other method in all metrics. Therefore, gaining insight into the strengths and limitations of different control flow recovery methods is valuable. To provide insight, this project distils key ideas from three primary methods of control flow recovery, showcasing their strengths and providing intuition for their failure modes. Based on these insights, ideas for further improvements and future research are presented.
