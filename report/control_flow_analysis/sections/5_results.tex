\section{Results}

This section details the results of the control flow recovery methods, when applied to the test programs outlined in section \ref{sec:criteria_for_selection_of_test_programs}. To provide an overview, the results presented are based on the combined test programs of Coreutils and SQLite (individual results of Coreutils and SQLite test programs are presented in appendix \ref{app:coreutils_test_programs} and \ref{app:sqlite_test_programs}, respectively).

Note, due to time constraints in the project, the author has decided to focus on implementing and integrating two out of the three control flow recovery methods with the test suite. Thus, the results present include the results of the Hammock method and the Interval method, but does not include the results of the Pattern-independent method. To help assess the effectiveness of the reviewed methods, they are compared against the theoretical optimum, as further described in section \ref{sec:interpretation_of_results}.

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
\label{sec:interpretation_of_results}

The results are to be interpreted as follows (previously described in section \ref{sec:project_thesis}).

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{true positive}: control flow primitive \textit{recovered} and \textit{present} in the original source code.
	\item \textbf{false positive}: control flow primitive \textit{recovered} but \textit{not present} in the original source code.
	\item \textbf{false negative}: control flow primitive \textit{present} in the original source code but \textit{not recovered}.
\end{itemize}

In the context of evaluation of effective control flow recovery, \textit{true positive} results are good while both \textit{false positive} and \textit{false negative} results are bad. Extensions to these evaluation metrics are discussed in section \ref{sec:extensions_to_evaluation_metric}.

To provide further perspective, the results of each control flow recovery method are presented along-side the theoretical optimum. The \textit{theoretical optimum} control flow recovery is that all control flow primitives present in the original source code are recovered with correct types (i.e. \textit{true positives}) and that no control flow primitives not present in the original source code are recovered (i.e. \textit{false positives}). Note, by definition, this means that for each control flow primitive type the theoretical optimum has 0 \textit{false negatives}, 0 \textit{false positives} and exactly as many \textit{true positives} as there are control flow primitives of the specific type in the original source code.
