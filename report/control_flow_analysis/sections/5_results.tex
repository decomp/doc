\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section details the results of the control flow recovery methods, when applied to the test programs outlined in section \ref{sec:criteria_for_selection_of_test_programs}. To provide an overview, the results presented are based on the combined test programs of Coreutils and SQLite (individual results of Coreutils and SQLite test programs are presented in appendix \ref{app:coreutils_test_programs} and \ref{app:sqlite_test_programs}, respectively).

Note, due to time constraints in the project, the author has decided to focus on implementing and integrating two out of the three control flow recovery methods with the test suite. Thus, the results present include the results of the Hammock method and the Interval method, but does not include the results of the Pattern-independent method. To help assess the effectiveness of the reviewed methods, they are compared against the theoretical optimum, as further described in section \ref{sec:interpretation_of_results}.
