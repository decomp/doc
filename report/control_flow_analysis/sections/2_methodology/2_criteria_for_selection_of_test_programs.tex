\subsection{Criteria for Selection of Test Programs}
\label{sec:criteria_for_selection_of_test_programs}

As part of a broader Open Science movement, the test data\footnote{Test data: \url{https://github.com/decomp/testdata}} and source code\footnote{Source code: \url{https://github.com/decomp/decomp}} of this research project are released open source.

To facilitate reproducible evaluation results, the test programs must be open source and explicitly tracked by a specific version number or version control revision, and they must be provided free of charge to the wider public. While unfortunate, this excludes test programs from the Standrad Performance Evaluation Corporation (\url{http://spec.org}) as those test programs are not made available free of charge to the wider public.

% TODO: Update the version numbers of SQLite and Coreutils.

For coverage of real world applications, the shell from the SQLite project (version 3.25.0) and 107 tools from the GNU Core Utilities project (version 8.30) are included in the test data. The scientific community have in recent years converged on utilizing GNU Core Utilities to evaluate control flow recovery methods \cite{no_more_gotos,homan_centric_decompilation,interprocedural_control_flow_recovery,semantics_preserving_structural_analysis,revng}.

% TODO: remove paragraph about pathological test programs?

%The control flow recovery methods will also be evaluated on pathological test programs which have been automatically generated to contain hundreds or thousands of nested control flow primitives.

% TODO: Add specific revision for testdata repo.
