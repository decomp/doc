\subsection{Project Aim and Objectives}

The aim of this project is to evaluate a set of control flow recovery methods, assess their effectiveness at identifying high-level control flow primitives in control flow graphs, and provide insight into the trade-offs made between the different methods of control flow recovery.

To achieve this aim, the following objectives have been identified:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{itm:obj_define_effectiveness_metric} Define a metric for measuring the effectiveness of control flow recovery.
	\item \label{itm:obj_review_cfa_methods} Review a set of distinct control flow recovery methods present in research.
	\item \label{itm:obj_cfa_components} Determine if there exist public implementations for the reviewed control flow recovery methods; and if not develop implementations.
	\item \label{itm:obj_cfa_evaluation} Evaluate the control flow recovery methods against the defined effectiveness metric.
\end{enumerate}
