\subsection{Project Thesis}

% TODO: progression/spectrum?

The thesis of this project is that upon evaluation of the three distinct methods of control flow recovery (see section \ref{sec:hammock_method}, \ref{sec:interval_method} and \ref{sec:pattern-independent_method}), they will fall on a progression from \textit{many} false negatives and \textit{no} false positives for the Hammock method; to \textit{some} false negatives and \textit{some} false positives for the Interval method; to \textit{no} false negatives and \textit{many} false positives for the Pattern-independent method.

Put more concretely,
\begin{itemize}
	\item the \textbf{Hammock method} will only recover \textit{some} control flow primitives present in the original source code, but will \textit{never} introduce control flow primitives not present in the original source code;
	\item the \textbf{Interval method} will recover \textit{most} control flow primitives present in the original source code, but will introduce \textit{some} control flow primitives not present in the original source code; and
	\item the \textbf{Pattern-independent method} will recover \textit{all} control flow primitives present in the original source code, but will introduce \textit{many} control flow primitives not present in the original source code.
\end{itemize}
