\subsection{Continuous Integration}
\label{sec:ver_continuous_integration}

This project makes use of Travis CI, which is tightly integrated with GitHub, to run a series of automated tests for each commit to the source code repository. The tests are varied and range from identifying source code formatting and coding style issues to monitoring the build status and test coverage. A future ambition is to run benchmarks for each commit to quickly identify performance regressions.
