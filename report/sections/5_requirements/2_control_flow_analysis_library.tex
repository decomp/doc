\subsection{Control Flow Analysis Library}
\label{sec:req_control_flow_analysis_library}

A decision was made early on to only support decompilation of compiler generated code from structured high-level languages (\textbf{R9}). Support for arbitrary, unstructured and obfuscated code has been intentionally omitted (\textbf{R18}) to avoid a myriad of special cases.

The control flow analysis library must recover the high-level control flow primitives of pre-test loops (\textbf{R10}), infinite loops (\textbf{R11}), 1-way conditionals (\textbf{R12}) and 2-way conditionals (\textbf{R13}), as these are found in virtually every high-level language today~\cite{reverse_comp}. Post-test loops (\textbf{R14}) and n-way conditionals (\textbf{R15}) are also common - but not found in every language (e.g. Go has no \texttt{do-while} loops and Python has no \texttt{switch} statements) - and should therefore be recovered. Support for multi-exit loops (\textbf{R16}) and nested loops (\textbf{R17}) could be included if time permits. The recovery of compound boolean expressions is intentionally deferred (\textbf{R19}) as it would require analysis of instructions within basic blocks in addition to the CFG analysis.
