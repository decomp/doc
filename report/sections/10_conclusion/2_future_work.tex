\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:con_future_work}

The primary focus for planned future work is to stress test the design of the decompilation pipeline and its individual components. A secondary focus is to improve the quality and the reliability of the components. A tertiary focus is to extend the capabilities of the decompilation pipeline. This prioritization strives to validate the core of the system before extending it.
