Decompilation or reverse compilation is the process of translating low-level machine-readable code into high-level human-readable code. The problem is non-trivial due to the amount of information lost during compilation, but it can be divided into several smaller problems which may be solved independently. This report explores the feasability of composing a decompilation pipeline from independent components, and the potential of exposing its components to the end-user.

% --- [ Methodology/design ] ---------------------------------------------------

The decompilation pipeline consists of several components which are conceptually grouped into three modules to separate logic related to the source. The front-end module translates a source language (e.g. x86 Assembly) into LLVM IR; a platform-independent low-level intermediate representation. The middle-end identifies high-level control flow primitives (e.g. 2-way conditionals, pre-test loops) in the LLVM IR. The back-end uses this information to translate the LLVM IR into a high-level target programming language (Go).

% The control flow analysis component of the decompiler pipeline utilizes subgraph isomorphism search algorithms to identify and reconstruct high-level control flow primitives from LLVM IR, which is a platform-independent low-level intermediate representation used by the LLVM compiler framework.

The control flow analysis operates directly on graphs and is not dependent on either LLVM IR or

% --- [ Results ] --------------------------------------------------------------

% * What you found

The decompilation pipeline has been proven capable of recovering nested pre-test and post-test loops (e.g. while, do-while), and 1-way and 2-way conditionals (e.g. if, if-else) from LLVM IR.

A post-processing stage deals with language-specific features

Each stage of the pipeline is extensible; and in practise it took less than 3 hours to extend the post-processing stage to simplify the loop-header of pre-test loops (from init;while(cond){post} to for(init; cond; post)) by locating surrounding initialization and post-statements

Each stage of the decompilation pipeline is easily extensible. For example the post-processing stage was extended to simplify pre-test loops by locating the initialization and post-statement

The decompiler pipeline has proven easily extensible and flexible. It is capable of recovering nested pre-test loops, 2-way conditionals,

%As an example, building upon the existing infrastructure and extending the post-translation source code cleanup; it took less than three hours to implement a source code translation rule which propagates initialization and post-statements of for-loops

%from the block statments to the for-loop header.

%The decompiler pipeline successfully identifies and recovers high-level reconstructed smaller

There exists huge potential for future development. Investigate adding further post-processing stages to make the Go output more idiomatic; e.g. the \texttt{grind} tool by Russ Cox moves variable declarations closer to their usage. Finish developing the LLVM IR library to replace the C++ bindings with a pure Go implementation; consider \texttt{llgo} a potential future user. Validate the language-agnostic aspects of the design by implementing components in other languages; e.g. data flow analysis in Haskell. Verify that the middle-end handles heavy decompilation tasks (i.e. control flow analysis, data flow analysis) by implementing additional back-ends (e.g. Python output).
